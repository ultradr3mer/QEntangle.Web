      Quantum mechanics is full of seemingly random events. This is the only place where randomness happens in this otherwise deterministic universe. Quantum systems collapse instantaneously even if they span light years. The Many-worlds interpretation <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Many-worlds_interpretation">Many-worlds interpretation</a> of quantum mechanics is the only completely coherent approach to explaining both the contents of quantum mechanics and the appearance of the world.<br />

      Where the traditional interpretation describes a collapse of the wave function as the result of being observed, the Many-worlds interpretation suggests that every possible outcome happens every time, but the observer becomes entangled or correlated with the quantum system and is split into an infinite number of versions, each observing one single outcome. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/1veritasium">Veritasium</a> made a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTXTPe3wahc">very nice video</a> on this topic.

      This website allows you to act depending on a quantum particle in a superposition and doing so put yourself in a superposition. Just like Schrödinger's cat, you can do or be two things at the same time.<br />

      Putting yourself in superposition appears to yield certain advantages. The most obvious being increased resistance towards death. For example, you can't die on a trip if you entangled the decision whether or where this trip is taken.<br />
      Besides that a life with a high degree of entanglement can be considered a richer one. You will see more places and try out a lot more different things. Of course right now it is not possible to travel between multiverses. But establishing an information link between them could be possible. Once such a link is established you will certainly benefit from the experiences of living not one life but many.
